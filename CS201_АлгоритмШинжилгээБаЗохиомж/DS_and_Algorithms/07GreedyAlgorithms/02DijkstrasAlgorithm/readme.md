Dijkstra's algorithm allows us to find the shortest path between any two vertices of a graph.

It differs from the minimum spanning tree because the shortest distance between two vertices might not include all the vertices of the graph.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm Applications

* To find the shortest path

* In social networking applications

* In a telephone network

* To find the locations in the map
